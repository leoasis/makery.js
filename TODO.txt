- Test named blueprints
- Support for more than one parameter in constructor
- Remove function property auto call in make, leave that only for
  the blueprint (like in Machinist).
- Add hook chaining with overriding. Don't know if this is cool or
  we should just leave the hooks for the blueprints, anyway
  afterCreation when using make can be done directly without the
  hook. Perhaps we should remove the hook call in the make options
  at all.
